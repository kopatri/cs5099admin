3. The notebook "CORD-19-software-classification-cs5099.ipynb" categorizes software mentions and requires the output of the notebook "CORD-19-software-counting-cs5099.ipynb" as prerequisite. 
4. The notebook "CORD-19-collect-scopus-data-CS5099.ipynb" fetches the SCOPUS API for affiliation and core data.
5. The notebook "CORD-19-analyse-coredata-CS5099.ipynb" analyzes fetched core data.
6. The notebook "CORD-19-analyse-affiliation-data-CS5099.ipynb" analyzes fetched affiliation data.
