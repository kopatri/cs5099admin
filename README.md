# Habeas Corpus

This is work done during the hack day at [Collaborations Workshop 2021](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw21), to create a **corpus of research software used for COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research** that will be useful in a number of ways to the research software sustainability community around the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/). This is based on and extends the "CORD-19 Software Mentions" dataset published by the Chan Zuckerberg Institute (doi: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncs0).
